## Data Cleaning Procedures
1. **Handling Missing Values**:

3. **Outlier Detection and Treatment**:
   - Conducted outlier detection to identify and address any extreme values, ensuring they do not skew the analysis results.

4. **Categorical Data Encoding**:
   - Categorical variables such as `Marital Status`, `Gender`, `Education`, `Occupation`, `Home Owner`, `Commute Distance`, `Region`, and `Purchased Bike` were handled appropriately for analysis.

## Key Insights

1. **Income and Bike Purchase**:

2. **Age Distribution**:
   - The majority of bike buyers fall within the age range of 30 to 50 years, indicating a trend that middle-aged individuals are more inclined to purchase bikes.
